function [W,V1,S] = generateAN_TEST(Hb , Q , U, despread_matrix, e , type)
% Function that generates the AN vector (W) in order to implement security
% for the TR communication scheme. 
%
% W has no effect at the legitimate receiver position, but corrupt the
% correct detection at any eavesdropper position.
% The channel between TX and the legitimate RX is H. It is of dimensions 
% [Q,1]. We need to keep the despreading process into account such
% that, after despreading: S^H.*H.*W = 0
% 
%
% INPUTS
%   H: legeitimate receiver's channel --> [H] = [Q,1]
%   Q: number of OFDM subcarriers
%   U: Back Of Rate used for the communication
%   despread_matrix: Despreading matrix --> [S] = [Q/U,Q]
%   e : energy of the artifical noise (AN) vector
%
% OUTPUT:
%   W: (AN) vector

        % Resolve the underdetermined system --> leads to peaks of power
        % To keep into account the U effect, as well as the despreading, 
        % the following steps are implemented:
        %   1. Create W, random variable with ,Q/U less elements
        %   2. Create G = H.*W, with [G] = [Q,1] 
        %   3. Split G in G1 and G2, with G1 determined and G2 to be found.
        %   4. Split S in S1 and S2, both determined
        %   5. Find the last elements of W thanks to S1 S2 G1 G2.
