function H2H2 = modelCorrelH2H2(N,U,T)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Modelization of  ∑_i ∑j!=i |Hb,n+iN|^2 |Hb,n+jN|^2 when frequency 
% correlation at Bob is introduced                         
% This term is needed for the determination of E[|SINR_b|] when frequency
% correlation among subcarriers is introduced.
%
% INPUTS:
%   N : Number of symbol sent (N = Q/U)
%   U : Back-off rate
%   T : Choleski decomposition of correlation matrix RHO, s.t. T T^H = RHO
%
% OUTPUT:
%   H2H2 : Expected value of 
%   ∑_i ∑j!=i |Hb,n+iN|^2 |Hb,n+jN|^2
%
