function var = modelVariance(alpha,N,U,T,type)

%
% Modelization of variance of Bob/Eve SINR when frequency correlation is 
% introduced.
% This term is needed in order to better approximate the capacity at Bob/
% Eve when frequency correlation among subcarriers is introduced.
% 
% var = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 where X is Bob/Eve SINR
%
% INPUTS:
%   alpha : percentage of data energy injected in the communication
%   N : Number of symbol sent (N = Q/U)
%   U : Back-off rate
%   T : Choleski decomposition of correlation matrix RHO, s.t. T T^H = RHO
%   type : Scenario that has to be modelized
%
% OUTPUT:
%   var : The modelized variance
